    // User Authentication and Authorization: Implement user accounts with roles and permissions to control access to different parts of the system.
    //DONE -  Database Integration: Integrate a database (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL) to store inventory data persistently. This will allow for better data management and scalability.
    // DONE - Search and Filtering: Add functionality to search and filter inventory items based on various criteria such as name, category, supplier, etc.
    // Reporting: Create reports and analytics to provide insights into inventory trends, such as inventory levels, items sold, supplier performance, etc.
    //DONE - Notifications: Implement notifications for low stock levels, item expiration dates, or new items added to the inventory.
    // DONE - RESTful API: Develop a RESTful API to allow external applications or services to interact with your inventory system. This could enable integrations with other systems or custom front-end applications.
    // Batch Operations: Allow users to perform batch operations like adding multiple items at once, updating quantities, or deleting items.
    // Order Management: Extend the system to handle orders, including creation, processing, and tracking of orders for inventory replenishment.
    // Audit Trail: Implement logging and auditing functionality to track changes made to inventory items, user actions, and system events.
    // Integration with External Systems: Integrate with other business systems such as accounting software, ERP systems, or e-commerce platforms for seamless data exchange.
    // Data Import/Export: Enable users to import and export inventory data in various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) for bulk operations or integration with external systems.
    // Scheduled Tasks: Implement scheduled tasks for automatic processes such as inventory updates, report generation, or data backups.
